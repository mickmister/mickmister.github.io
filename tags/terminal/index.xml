      <description>Note: this only applies to MacOS
Often times while I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to search for something on the internet to solve a problem. I usually use the search engine created by Google, called Google. When I need to search for something, I always have to stop what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and switch over to a browser to type in my search. This may not seem like a big deal because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that much time, but in reality this is a context switch.</description>
