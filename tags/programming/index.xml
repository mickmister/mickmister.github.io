      <description>Note: this only applies to MacOS
Often times while I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to search for something on the internet to solve a problem. I usually use the search engine created by Google, called Google. When I need to search for something, I always have to stop what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and switch over to a browser to type in my search. This may not seem like a big deal because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that much time, but in reality this is a context switch.</description>

      <description>State management in React is a widely discussed topic on the internet. While the most common approach for large applications seems to be Redux, there has been a lot of attention on the improvements of the React Context API. Using render props, we can now access state being held far up the tree with ease. For a single page application, this is ideal because the whole application is one tree.</description>

      <description>Here are some projects I have worked in the past couple of years. Some are personal projects, and some are projects from school.
Jam App Repo: https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jam-app
A music application used to make playing music and improvising with others easier. It allows users to build progressions on the fly and distribute them among other members&amp;rsquo; devices to visually show the structure of what is to come.
It also sends midi information to instruments and allows the user to control which notes should be held out.</description>
