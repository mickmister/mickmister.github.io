<p>Here are some projects I have worked in the past couple of years. Some are personal projects, and some are projects from school.</p>

<h2 id="jam-app">Jam App</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jam-app">https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jam-app</a></p>

<p>A music application used to make playing music and improvising with others easier. It allows users to build progressions on the fly and distribute them among other members&rsquo; devices to visually show the structure of what is to come.</p>

<p>It also sends midi information to instruments and allows the user to control which notes should be held out. The user dynamically decides when they should be held down, when they should be let go, and when to switch to another chord. This allows the user to play multiple instruments at once. There is no need for a metronome. This way, the drummer has control of the tempo, rather than the clock of a loop machine.</p>

<h2 id="jira-slack-bot">JIRA Slack Bot</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jira-slack">https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jira-slack</a></p>

<p>A slackbot used to create tickets and store slack conversations in ticket descriptions. It is not very feature-rich at the moment, but it has played a big role in team workflow.</p>

<h2 id="integer-notation-website">Integer Notation Website</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/mickmister/integer-notation">https://github.com/mickmister/integer-notation</a></p>

<p>Hosted: <a href="http://michaelkochell.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music">http://michaelkochell.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music</a></p>

<p>A small website written in vanilla js used to help learn piano and skills, in integer notation. It is not common that integer notation is used as a teaching/learning tool, but it has helped me and my friends that have used this tool.</p>

<p>There is a digital piano and a chord progression system. Chords can be added to a progression to play back. You can make some cool sounds by overloading the program with simultaneous progression playback.</p>

<h2 id="music-sniper">Music Sniper</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/music-sniper">https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/music-sniper</a></p>

<p>A music application used to crop audio files and share/collaborate with friends. It is underdeveloped at the moment.</p>

<p>I plan on making a bridge between this and the Jam App, to handle compositions.</p>

<h2 id="sad-or-not-sad">Sad or Not Sad</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/mickmister/MachineLearningMusic">https://github.com/mickmister/MachineLearningMusic</a></p>

<p>A Python script used to determine if a song is sad or not. The input is a chromagram csv.</p>

<h2 id="des">DES</h2>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/mickmister/DES">https://github.com/mickmister/DES</a></p>

<p>An implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) written in C. The AES algorithm used in SSL handshakes is based off of DES.</p>
