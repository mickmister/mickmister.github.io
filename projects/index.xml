      <description>Here are some projects I have worked in the past couple of years. Some are personal projects, and some are projects from school.
Jam App Repo: https://gitlab.com/mjkochell/jam-app
A music application used to make playing music and improvising with others easier. It allows users to build progressions on the fly and distribute them among other members&amp;rsquo; devices to visually show the structure of what is to come.
It also sends midi information to instruments and allows the user to control which notes should be held out.</description>
